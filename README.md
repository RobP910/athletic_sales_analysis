You'll analyze sales data to gain insights into which cities in the U.S. have sold the most athletic wear over two years.

## Combine and Clean the Data
1) Import the two CSV files, athletic_sales_2020.csv and athletic_sales_2021.csv, and read them into DataFrames.
2) Check that the columns in the two DataFrames have similar names and data types.
3) Combine the two DataFrames by the rows using an inner join, and reset the index.
4) After combining the DataFrames, do the following:
  - Check if there are any null values.
  - Check each columnâ€™s data type.
  - Convert the "invoice_date" column to a datetime data type.
  - Confirm that the data type has been changed.
